This cell-based way of running code is particularly helpful for exploring code as Jupyter remembers all the information declared in previously ran cells.\n",

    "There's going to be a section every week where I ask you to investigate some Python that we didn't explicitly talk about during the session. Don't be afraid to Google things you don't understand - the point of this section is to get you exploring Python yourself a bit more and building confidence for independent work!\n",

    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another data structure we didn't look at that is worth considering - the set. Sets are like lists but with some differences: duplicates are *not allowed* in sets, and they are unordered, unindexable and the elements cannot be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list, we use curly brackets (`{}`) like a dictionary, but only provide items rather than key value pairs separated by colons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a set, attempting to add duplicate items and `print` the result.\n",
    "2) Using the `dir` command, or Google, try and find the way to add elements to the set (it's not `.append()`!)\n",
    "3) Sets are used in many cases where we want to compare if two groups both contain the same elements, without caring how many of said element exists. Consider the two sets below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}\n",
    "b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you find a way to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the numbers that are in both `a` and `b`?\n",
    "* Create a new set from `a` and `b` containing all numbers in both `a` and `b`?\n",
    "* Create a new set from `a` without any elements that are in `b`?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The other builtin data structure in Python is the Tuple. Tuples are like lists, but are immutable (cannot be changed after defining them). They're helpful in cases where we know the data structure is definetely not going to change. Tuples are defined in the same way as lists, but using round brackets `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try and complete all the exersises for the lists above, but with a tuple instead. Which, if any of the questions are impossible?"
