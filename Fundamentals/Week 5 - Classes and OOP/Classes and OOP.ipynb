    "Classes allow us to structure our projects in a way where we can think of things as different types of entities operating and interacting with different things. This way of writing programs where we define custom *objects* defining what they are and what they can do forms the basis for Object Orientated Programming (or OOP).\n",

These `User`s might have a `Permissions` object (again defined by us) within that contains all the information as to what that user can do. This is helpful as it makes designing our complex code easier - it untangles our system into a number of actors each with their own defined available actions and attributes.\n",

Most classes will need a `__init__` method - this method is called when the object is initialised (or created).\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is very abstract and involved, so don't worry if you find these exercises hard. Try your best and don't be afraid to use Google!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending the Shape Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the code from today's session and edit it to add the following functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a `calculate_perimeter` method for `Rectangle`s that calculates the perimeter of a rectangles. Will this work for `Squares`? Why?\n",
    "* Add a `Pentagon` class with sensible attributes as we've done with `Rectangle`s. What should this inherit from? Why?\n",
    "* Add a `Circle` class - what should this inherit from and are there any problems with that inheritance? Can you come up with a good solution? Also add a `calculate_area` static method that gives the area of a circle.\n",
    "* Add the `__eq__` method to both the `Rectangle` and `Circle`. Can we remove anything from the `Square` class now?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fruit Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new class called `Fruit` that has the following attributes: `name`, `colour`, `bites_left`, and a method \"`take_bite`\" that sets `self.bites_left` to one less than it's current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create an `Orange` and `Apple` class that inherit from the `Fruit` class. In this world, all `Oranges` are `\"orange\"` and all `Apples` are `\"green\"`, but can be different sizes (take a different number of bites to eat!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code looks pretty good - we now have `Oranges`, `Apples` and a generic `Fruit` class for other fruits that we can extend on. However, we have a problem. Users are trying to use the method `take_bite` on a brand new orange and eating the peel as well as the orange itself! We need to find a way to model this. *Only for the `Orange` class*, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a `peeled` attribute (always set to `False` on object instantisation)\n",
    "* Add a `peel()` method that sets `peeled` to `True`\n",
    "* Override `take_bite` so that if the `Orange` is not peeled, we do not reduce the number of bites left and `print` a message telling the user they are trying to bite into an unpeeled `Orange`. Otherwise, allow the user to take a bite as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Oranges` and `Apples` are both perfect spheres. Write a static method on the `Fruit` class to calculate their volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! We now have a good model of `Fruits`. Now create a new class `FruitBasket` with the following functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `fruits` attribute with a list of fruits currently in the basket\n",
    "* A `size` attribute defining the maximum number of fruits allowed to be in the list\n",
    "* An `add_fruit()` method allowing users to add a fruit to the basket *only if the basket isn't full* (number of fruits is less than the size)\n",
    "* A `snack()` method that loops through each fruit in the basket and tries to take one bite of each fruit. (note - you do not have to worry about `Oranges` not being bite-able for now!)\n",
    "* **TRICKY**: A `peel_all()` method that loops through each fruit and tries to peel it if it is an `Orange` (you will need to use the `isinstance()` function)\n",
    "* **HARD**: A `clean()` method that loops through each fruit and removes it from the basket if it has 0 (or fewer) bites left.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bank Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been employed by a bank to rewrite their banking system in Python. They need the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Account` class with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attributes for an account number, sort code, name of the owner and balance.\n",
    "* Methods for `withdraw` and `deposit` funds that decrease/increase the balance respectively. If the balance is below 0, `withdraw` should print a warning telling the user they are in their overdraft\n",
    "* A `transfer` method that takes another `Account` and reduces the balance of one account while increasing the balance of the other.\n",
    "* A `__str__` method that prints out the information for the `Account`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Customer` class with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attribute for name, age, address and a list of accounts they own.\n",
    "* A method for adding an account to the `Customer` account list. This should check that the `Customer` name and `Account` name are the same, and if not, print a message.\n",
    "* A `total_balance` method that sums all the balances of the accounts a user has and prints the result.\n",
    "* A `__str__` method that prints out the users information, as well as all the accounts a user has. Try to use the `__str__` method of the `Account` to do this!\n",
    "\n",
