    "\n",
    "It may sound obvious, but all the files on your computer are just bytes, and readable by Python in one way or another. The file format should have a specification that defines how the file is organised; sometimes this can give away some interesting properties. For example, if you change the extension on a Word document file to `.zip`, you'll find that it's actuall just a zip folder of `.xml` files!\n",

    "Later on in your programming journey, you might have to study and/or write these filetype specification (I have!). In this session, we'll look at some of the easiest to work with - text files, csv and json files. The file types used in programming applications are usually pretty simple and human readable anyway!\n",

    "*Absolute* filepaths give the full location of the file - for example, `C://Users/stmball/Documents/Code/Continuing Education/Fundamentals/Week 7 - Reading and Writing Files/hello.txt`. This is the full location of the file - however as you can see, in a well organised system may be a bit unwieldy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Relative* filepaths give the location of the target file relative to the file you're currently in. For example, as this file is in the same folder as `hello.txt`, we can either reference it just by the filename or by `./hello.txt`. Two rules for relative filepaths are that `./` refers to the current folder and `../` refers to the parent folder - so I can sneakily navigate my filesystem by chaining `../` and folder names together!\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on File Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "On your operating system, it's extremely likely you have different file permission for different users and user groups - for example some system files will only be readable and writable by administrators (or the `root` user), whereas other files might be read-only for all users. As such, we need to tell Python what we are doing with the file we are opening. By default, Python opens the file in read mode - meaning we can view the file but not write to it. It's also good practice to only give Python the minimum permissisons it needs for working with files to avoid overwriting data!\n",

It's very common for a library to be centered around an object that defines what the library does - think about the `DateTime` object for `datetime` or the plot object in matplotlib. If this object requires you loading some data into it from a file, very often that library will have some built in methods for loading the file. The easiest example here is `pandas` - a library that brings R's excellent dataframes into Python to manage labelled data in an intelligent fashion. `pandas` has a plethora of tools for importing data in a consise way - for example for csv data we have:"
