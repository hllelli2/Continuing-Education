    "Using what we have learned so far, we could actually already code anything we wanted to, as long as we had infinite time and space on our comptuer. Obviously we don't, and we value our time a bit more than that, so today we are going to look at how to speed things up using iteration and loops in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of loops in Python, the `for` loop and the `while` loop. The choice of which is used is usually for readabilty (with a few exceptions), as most `for` loops can be written as `while` loops and vice versa. We'll start with looking at how for loops work: \n",

    "We have seen a number of different \"list like\" objects so far - lists themselves, strings, tuples, sets, and even dictionaries. We say these types are \"iterable\" because we can \"iterate\" over them, getting an item from the element each time. For example, we can iterate over `\"apple\"` to give us each letter in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely what the `for` loop does - it runs over an iterable object and executes some code for every object in that collection. Let's take a look at a very simple example:"

There are a few tricks for this, but *usually* we want the condition to be checking a variable that changes over time.\n",

As part of this, we supplied the last number we wanted to add as part of the `range` function - but what happens if we want to keep making triangle numbers until we reach a goal? For that, a `while` loop makes more sense. Hopefully the below code is fairly self explainitory!"
