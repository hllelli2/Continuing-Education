    "# Week 1 - Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In these first few sessions, we will be focusing on learning the fundamentals of the Python programming language, to ensure we have a solid foundation to build upon when moving onto the data science portion of the course. If you are new to programming, these sessions will contain a lot of important information, and might seem to move quite quickly; therefore it is *extremely* important to ask questions if you don't understand, and complete the exercises at the end of each session to consolidate your learning. Fully understanding this section of the course will making the following sections far, far easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand you are familiar with programming already, these sessions are still worthwhile to introduce the Python syntax - there are a few differences between Python and other languages, and depending on how you feel about features such as static typing and the lack of braces for code blocks, you might find these differences very exciting or very annoying! Either way, love it or hate it, Python is the most popular language for working with data, so we have to learn to work with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each notebook there will be a collection of exercises. These range from covering what we have learnt during the session, to questions that will require some independent research on how to solve. AS we move through the course, the questions will move more towards the latter type; the reason for this is to build independence - after all, the majority of coding is learning how to use Google and effectively!\n",

    "Python is an Object Oriented Language (OOP) - the specific meaning of this is rather abstract and can be a bit confusing, so let's start with an informal intuition of what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we have *things* - these things, for example, a bit of text, or a number, can be displayed to us by using the `print()` function. In this code, we have the text \"Hello World!\", and are `print`ing that to the console:"

    "If you play around with this code, you might notice that the second function call seems redundant. You may have also encountered that instead of writing `print(\"Hello World\")`, we can type `\"Hello World\"`, run the cell and we will get a similar looking output.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen some functions that come with the core Python library, and we also know how to import other people's functions; but how can we make our own? The syntax for defining our own function is as follows, using a simple function called `my_add()` to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every function definition starts with the `def` keyword - this signifies to Python that a function definition is coming up. Then, the name of the function - here I am using `my_add`. We then need to type the inputs of the function in brackets - these are not variables that have defined values, buy *dummy* variables that exist to tell Python what to do with the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then must start an indented code block (preferably indented by 4 spaces or a tab) to denote that what follows is the function definition itself. Lots of Python's syntax relies on horizontal whitespace to understand what's going on.

Well, if you need to calculate one of these intermediate steps later on in your program, you already have the function ready made!\n",

This can only be one object, and after the value is `return`ed, the function call ends and the rest of the code in the function is skipped. We can only return one object, but that object can be a list or another data structure that contains multiple bits of information. Note that we do **not** `print()` the output of the function, even though this gives us a similar visual output in the notebooks. This is because `print()`ing *does not* pass information through with Python. In other words:\n",

When our condition for control is simple, we can just use the `if` statement as follows; here we are writing a function to determine if a number is equal to 10 or not. Note the similarity to the function definition syntax - we start with the relevant keyword (here `if`), and we have an indented block of code signifying what to do if the if statement is true. There are some important differences however - the condition after the `if` keyword is simply written as-is; we use the `==` operator to test for equality since the `=` operator is reserved for variable assignment; and we can also follow the `if` statement block with an `else` statement block to handle all cases."
